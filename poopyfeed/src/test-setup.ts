/**
 * Vitest setup file for Angular tests.
 *
 * Angular 21 uses zoneless change detection by default.
 * The Angular test builder (ng test) handles TestBed initialization
 * via its generated init-testbed.js setup file.
 *
 * For async operations in tests, use:
 *   await fixture.whenStable()
 * instead of arbitrary setTimeout delays.
